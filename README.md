In this game (which is definetly not based on 'Flappy Bird') you have to avoid different obstacles in order to survive and gain as many points as you can. The main charcter of the game is Kolobok - a famous figure in slavic folklore, though he's not the only variant you can choose before playing this masterpiece. And yes - don't forget to select your own background, as we provide our players with the wide variety of possible options in order to make the your experience more enjoyable and relaxing. ;)
